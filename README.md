# dotfiles

## Description
Configuration files for current dev environment

## homebrew packages
Some of the packages used in !oh-my-zsh were installed using homebrew. Was not sure how to include those packages within dotfiles repo so for now will be listing them below.

* exa
* peco

## TODO
* One improvement could be switching brew packages to be managed through zsh plugins (use zsh-exa or zsh-peco)
 * Caveat: zsh shell seems significantly slower when adding more plugins
* Add a plugin manager (antigen or antibody)
* Add peco change directory mapped to Ctrl + F. Wasn't able to find a package for this
